This is the report for a blackbox Linux network investigation & penetration test. The task was to enumerate and document an unknown network and find any vulnerabilities within the systems/nodes. A second task was to critique and give advice on the network design and suggest remediations for any vulnerabilities that were found.

One of my favourite courseworks in university, learned an interesting enumeration method that I had personally not seen in penetration testing challenges before and also learned to move around in a multi-subnet network with the help of pivoting.
